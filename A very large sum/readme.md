## Synopsis
	Given an array of integers of size N, print the sum of the elements of the array, allowing for test cases with integers that may be quite large.

###Input:
	The first line of the input consists of an integer N. The next line contains N space-separated integers contained in the array.

###Constraints:
	N should be equal to or greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10
	The length will be equal to or greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1010

###Output
	The data output should be the sum of all the integers in the array.
