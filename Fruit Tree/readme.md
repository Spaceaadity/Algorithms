##Synopsis
A special fruit tree goes through 2 cycles of growth every year. Each spring, it doubles in height. Each summer, its height increases by 1 meter.

Someone plants one of these fruit tree saplings with a height of 1 meter at the onset of spring. How tall will her tree be after N growth cycles?

###Input Format

The first line contains an integer, T, the number of test cases. 
T subsequent lines each contain an integer, N, denoting the number of cycles for that test case.

###Output Format

For each test case, print the height of the Utopian Tree after N cycles. Each height must be printed on a new line.

###Constraints 

1≤T≤10 
0≤N≤60
